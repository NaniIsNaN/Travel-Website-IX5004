Planning was super easy: excellent understanding of our needs/wishes; efficient response times; flexible and open to adapting the trip until it was just right. All the hotels had immaculate grounds and our guides were excellent, we built a bond very quickly and anyone having him as their guide would be very lucky. Horse and cart ride in Bagan was a highlight. ”

Don’t miss if traveling to Bagan the balloon ride, it was magical, a real once in a lifetime experience. Also, The Golden Rock was definitely worth the extra travel as was Mount Popa! I would definitely and have ALREADY recommended to others.”
